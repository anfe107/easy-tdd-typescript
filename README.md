# Easy TDD with TypeScript and Vitest

Examples relating to the [_Easy Test Driven Development with TypeScript and Vitest_](https://www.udemy.com/course/easy-test-driven-development-with-typescript-and-vitest) course on Udemy.com.

This repo contains the example code in both vitest and jest format. Though the course focuses on Vitest, the techniques are easily [converted to jest](./jest-users.md).

To use the code, navigate to:

`<vitest|jest>/<section>/<example name>`

Then within that directory, to try the tests:

```bash
npm i
npm run test
```

The code has been built with node20. You may use the `.nvmrc` file by typing `nvm use` if you're an `nvm` user.
