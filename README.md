# Easy TDD with TypeScript and Vitest

This repo contains the example code in both vitest and jest format.

To use the code, navigate to:

`<vitest|jest>/<section>/<example name>`

Then within that directory, to try the tests:

```bash
npm i
npm run test
```

The code has been built with node20. You may use the `.nvmrc` file by typing `nvm use` if you're an `nvm` user.

Examples relate to the Udemy Course _Easy Test Driven Development with TypeScript and Vitest_.
